    <h2> Adjust for <s>inflation</s> productivity. </h2>
    <p2>According to the Economic Policy Institute, the minimum wage adjusted for the increase in productivity since 1950 would come out to roughly $21 per hour in 2020 ­– triple what it is now at $7.25 per hour. 
      While productivity has soared since 1938, wages and salaries in the U.S. have been relatively stagnant since 1970, when wages truly began failing to keep up with productivity.</p2>
    <p3>Explore how productivity has changed the nature of the true minimum wage.  </p3>
