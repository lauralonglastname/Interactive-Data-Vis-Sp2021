Why in the application state if I start with "All" Federal doesnt work? even if i click on it?
/_ APPLICATION STATE _/
let state = {
data: [],
selection: "Federal", // + YOUR FILTER SELECTION
};

Why do we not need this:
/_ INITIALIZING FUNTION _/
function init(){}

why is the Year not anchored to the middle? *set x (width / 2)
how do i show every year on the x axis?
how do i get the y axis to show "$"?
how do i get the ticker at the end of x axis to be clean?
main.js line 132 - that console log returns an array of 0. *fixed
How do I get the area to not be the difference from the regression but the area underneath?
How to get the dots over the area fill?
Dot transitions are applied to seemingly random dots
