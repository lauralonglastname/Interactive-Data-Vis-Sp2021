- I think that I will be flipping my data sets so that the federal min wage project is narrative, and this one is exploratory. Is that ok?

For this project, I'd like to use World Bank Data about infrastructure in the US and China. US foreign policy is really framed around this 'race against China'. I think data about how we are investing in infrastructure, and what correlating outcomes are for each country, could be really thought provoking.

For the first exploratory data chart, I want to show relative categorical spending over time in a pie chart. A sliding scale would change the year and the data to show the % of spending on airtravel infrastructure increase the same time as rail decreases in the US, but how in China they both increase.

Then I would like to let people drill down into certain categories. This section woudl feature a dropdown menu that shows both the US and China spending in a line chart over time. This would show very clearly differences in spending like the rail lines.

And I would provide a similar dropdown menu with linecharts for US and China with different outcome data points, such as Gini Coefficient, GDP Growth, # of Patents, Foreign Direct Investment.
