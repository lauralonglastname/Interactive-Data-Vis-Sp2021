"Internet access is a human right, yet historically marginalized communities are still denied affordable broadband." - Darren Walker

New York recently announced a first-in-the-nation Affordable Internet Mandate. This means that internet service providers like Spectrum or Verizon Fios would need to provide a $15/month option. Currently a basic plan in New York starts at $50/month.

I will explore internet access as it relates to avg utility costs, to help visualize the digital divide across the country with a couple graphs:

1. Geographic Heat Map of Internet Access, with mouseover with detailed info about access. Not sure yet if county or state level is better.
2. Geographic Heat Map of Avg Monthly Internet Price
3. Graph of Internet Price as % of total utility costs per state

My data sources will include:
• FCC, Fixed Broadband Availability https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/maps/connect2health/#ll=40,-95&z=4&t=broadband&bbm=fixed_access&dmf=none&zlt=county
• US Census Data, Median Household Income 2018
• Average Utility Cost per capita per state https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database
• Data on average cost of internet plans per state https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-cost-by-state

If internet service providers are regulated by the FCC, then the federal government can set a country wide "Affordable Internet Mandate". My goal is to tell a story that show the gap in affordabiliity across the country, and use NY's $15/month plan as a model.
