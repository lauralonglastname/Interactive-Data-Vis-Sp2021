"Internet access is a human right, yet historically marginalized communities are still denied affordable broadband." - Darren Walker

New York recently announced a first-in-the-nation Affordable Internet Mandate. This means that internet service providers like Spectrum or Verizon Fios would need to provide a $15/month option. Currently a basic plan in New York starts at $50/month.

I will explore internet access as it relates to median income, to help visualize the digital divide across the country with a couple graphs:

My data sources will include:
• US Census Data, Internet Access Survey results 2018
• US Census Data, Median Household Income 2018
• Data on average cost of internet plans per state

If internet service providers are regulated by the FCC, then the federal government can set a country wide "Affordable Internet Mandate". My goal is to tell a story that show the gap in affordabiliity across the country, and use NY's $15/month plan as a model.
