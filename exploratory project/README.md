"Internet access is a human right, yet historically marginalized communities are still denied affordable broadband." - Darren Walker

New York recently announced a first-in-the-nation Affordable Internet Mandate. This means that internet service providers like Spectrum or Verizon Fios would need to provide a $15/month option. Currently a basic plan in New York starts at $50/month.

Is internet access an unequal cost burden across the country, like in NY? The goal of the project is to make a case for nationwide Affordable Internet Mandate.

The audience is the general public who are generally interested in internet access from a technical and cost perspective. By tying the cost of internet to the cost of utilities, the intent is to also talk about internet access as a public utility, sanctioning the government's involvement in price setting.

I will explore internet access as it relates to avg utility costs, to help visualize the digital divide across the country with a couple graphs:

1. Geographic Heat Map of Internet Access, with mouseover with detailed info about access. Not sure yet if county or state level is better.
2. Geographic Heat Map of Avg Monthly Internet Price
3. Graph of Internet Price as % of total utility costs per state

My data sources will include:
• FCC, Fixed Broadband Availability https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/maps/connect2health/#ll=40,-95&z=4&t=broadband&bbm=fixed_access&dmf=none&zlt=county
• US Census Data, Median Household Income 2018
• Average Utility Cost per capita per state https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database
• Data on average cost of internet plans per state https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-cost-by-state
