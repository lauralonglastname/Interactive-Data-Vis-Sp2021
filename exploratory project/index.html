    <h1>Minimum Wage 1938 - 2020 (in 2020 Dollars)</h1>
    <p>Some states, like Alabama, have never had a minimum wage. 
      So in 1938, the federal government instituted a country-wide minimum wage.
    </p>
    <p>The federal minimum wage is worth less today than when it was enacted.</p>
    <p>The Fight for 15 is simply a market correction.</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to let the user explore the history of the minimum wage, see the importance of a federal minimum wage in the context of how many states don't have one, and draw their own conclusions on what the Fight for 15 represents. </p>

    <p>I plan to add the data from 1938 to 1965 into this data set, and to make the federal line a permanent one so it will be easier to compare a state's min wage to the federal one.</p>
